I believe these will be immensely helpful to maximize the benefits of my Google Account.\n\nHowever, I would like to clarify a concern about the subscription link. May I know if this subscription is completely free, or if it comes with charge after a certain period?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and support.\n\nBest Regards,\nJessie"
